title: The Roofed Canyon
description: >-
    The Roofed Canyon is a Minecraft mod that adds a new unique biome with its own set of content, including mobs and blocks! From above the canopy The Roofed Canyon looks almost like your typical plains biome. But look under the canopy of the grassy leaf tree and you'll find a strange and surreal environment. Fight against sentient vegetables, and be wary of giant bats that guard this world from the light of day in this new mod!
