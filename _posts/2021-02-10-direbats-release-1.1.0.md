Well, it seems like "soon-ish" turned into, well...a good while. I blame global warming.
It's finally here though, a new Direbats release! This update features new a brand new model and texture for the Direbats, as well as new textures for all items in the mod, courtesy of [**Ninni**](/#the-team). Direbats have also received a bunch of new, original sounds made by [**Mr. Esuoh**](/#the-team). Lastly, there are several bug fixes and improvements that can all be seen in the changelog.

We hope you all enjoy this update, thanks for sticking with us.
