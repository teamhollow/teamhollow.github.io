These bats are all in for the halloween spirit, hiding in the darkness of the caves, or coming out on a full moon. Though they may seem cute and cuddly, **they are not very fond of light**, and will attack you if youâ€™re so foolish as to light up their abode. And be weary of what you've got on you. **They're quite greedy...**

**You can download Direbats for [Fabric](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/direbats-fabric) and [Forge](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/direbats-forge)**

In other news, **we are now Minecraft Suggestionâ€™s official mod development team**, be on the lookout for several exciting things involving them, as well as their awesome community, please be sure to check them out, you wonâ€™t want to miss what we have in store.
